    "Let's start with the basics of the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical concepts are absolutely necessary to understand what Machine Learning really is.<br>\n",
    "Data is interpreted as a **Collection of Vectors**. Thus, it is a must to introduce the concept of **Vectors**.<br>\n",
    "However, to introduce **Vectors**, we need to introduce the world in which they live and the properties that allow us to do operations with them (such as addition and multiplication by a number). This is why the concepts of **Field** and **Vector Spaces** are important. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Field\n",
    "A **Field** is a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in many areas in mathematics.\n",
    "* A **Field** $\\textbf{F}$ is a set containing at least two distinct elements called 0 and 1, along with operations of addition and multiplication (and others well-known properties such as commutativity, associativity, etc. \n",
    "    * The reason why 0 and 1 are present is because two properties allow for specific operations:\n",
    "        * Additive and multiplicative identity, which means $a + 0 = a$ and $a â‹… 1 = a$.\n",
    "    * It is represented by a bold letter **$\\textbf{F}$**.\n",
    "    * Example: $F = \\mathbb{R}$ is the field of real numbers and these \"numbers\" receive a fancy name: **scalars**.\n",
    "* A **higher-dimensional Field** is represented by $\\textbf{F}^{n}$, which means that this Field has **n** dimensions. An element of this field is represented by a **list of lenght n** which is an ordered collection of n elements denoted by $(x_1, ..., x_n)$, where each element lies on a its respective dimension.\n",
    "    *  Set Definition for $\\textbf{F}^n$:<br>\n",
    "    $\\textbf{F}^{n} = \\{(x_1, ..., x_n) : x_j \\in \\textbf{F}$ for $j = 1, ..., n\\}$, i.e., the set of n-dimensional lists."

    "### 1.2. Vector Space, Dimension, Span, Linear Independence, Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Vector Space** is a set of objects called **vectors**, which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers called scalars. <br>\n",
    "Vector spaces are the subject of Linear Algebra and are well-characterized by their **dimensions**, which, roughly speaking, specifiy the number of **independent directions** in the space.\n",

    "* A (real) line has 1 dimension because all points along the line can be reached by **spanning** the only vector needed to form its **basis**.\n",
    "* A plane has 2 dimensions because all points on the plane can be reached by **spanning** the only 2 vectors needed to form its **basis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By **Span**, we mean: \n",
    "* On 1-Dimension: take a vector $v$ and multiply it by a scalar (real number) $a_1$. Do this many times with different scalars and you will be able to reach every point in the real line and _span the real line_\n",
    "* On 2-Dimensions: take 2 vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ (that form a **basis** of $\\textbf{V}$), multiply them by two scalars $a_1$ and $a_2$ and add/subtract them. Do this many times with different scalars and you will be able to reach every point in the space and _span the space_.\n",
    "\n",
    "By **Basis**, we mean: \n",
    "\n",
    "A list of vectors in $\\textbf{V}$ that are **Linearly Independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By **Linearly Independent**, we mean:\n",
    "* Take a list of vectors $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$.\n",
    "* If neither vector in this list can be generated by a **linear combination** (adding and/or multiplying vectors by scalars is the process of generating new vectors in the space) of others vectors in this list, then we say that these vectors are **linearly independent**.\n",
    "* An example of a **Basis** is the one that forms the basis of the 3-D space:<br> <img src=\"/img/3d.png\" width=\"120\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the concept of **Dimension** is connected to the concept of a **Basis** of a **Vector Space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As we mentioned, a **Vector Space** is a set $\\textbf{V}$ where you can do two important things among its elements: addition and scalar multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of such properties, we say:\n",
    "* $\\textbf{V}$ is a Vector Space over a Field $\\textbf{F}$. \n",
    "* Elements are now called **vectors** or **points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in mathematics a vector is defined as an _Ordered List of <ins>Objects</ins>_, in Machine Learning Theory, a vector is an _Ordered List of <ins>Numbers</ins>_.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is assumed (or taken for granted if you prefer) that the Vector Space $\\textbf{V}$ is a **Real Vector Space**, i.e., $\\textbf{V} = \\mathbb{R}$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A good reason for this is that computers do operations with numbers and Machine Learning is done by computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to define a vector is to follow what is done in **Statistics** (and also in **Econometrics**):\n",
    "* A **vector** is defined as a **column-vector**. It is written as a bold character\n",

    "Vectors can also be interepreted as:\n",
    "* an array of numbers (a computer science view) , hence the horizontal writting format,\n",
