It is represented by a bold letter **$\\textbf{F}$**.\n",

    "* [Definition - Math] A **higher-dimensional Field** is represented by $\\textbf{F}^{n}$, which means that this Field has **n** dimensions. An element of this field is represented by a **list of lenght n** which is an ordered collection of n elements denoted by $(x_1, ..., x_2)$.\n",
