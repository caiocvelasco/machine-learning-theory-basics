    "## Data Structure\n",
    "Let's start with the basics of the basics.<br>\n",
    "Mathematical concepts are **absolutely** necessary to understand what Machine Learning really is.<br>\n",
    "Data is interpreted as a **Collection of Vectors**. Thus, it is a **must** to introduce the concept of **Vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field\n",
    "A **Field** is a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in many areas in mathematics.\n",
    "* A **Field** $\\textbf{F}$ is a set containing at least two distinct elements called 0 and 1, along with operations of addition and multiplication (and others well-known properties such as commutativity, associativity, etc. \n",
    "    * The reason why 0 and 1 are present is because two properties allow for specific operations:\n",
    "        * Additive and multiplicative identity, which means $a + 0 = a$ and $a â‹… 1 = a$.\n",
    "    * It is represented by a bold letter **$\\textbf{F}$**.\n",
    "    * Example: $F = \\mathbb{R}$ is the field of real numbers and these \"numbers\" receive a fancy name: **scalars**.\n",
    "* A **higher-dimensional Field** is represented by $\\textbf{F}^{n}$, which means that this Field has **n** dimensions. An element of this field is represented by a **list of lenght n** which is an ordered collection of n elements denoted by $(x_1, ..., x_n)$, where each element lies on a its respective dimension.\n",
    "    *  Set Definition for $\\textbf{F}^n$:<br>\n",
    "    $\\textbf{F}^{n} = \\{(x_1, ..., x_n) : x_j \\in \\textbf{F} for j = 1, ..., n\\}$, i.e., the set of n-dimensional lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Space\n",
    "A **Vector Space** is a set of objects called **vectors**, which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers called scalars. Vector spaces are the subject of Linear Algebra and are well characterized by their **dimension**, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of _independent directions_ in the space.\n",
    "* Quickly digression on _**Dimension**_:\n",
    "    * A real line has 1 dimension because all points can be reached by **spanning** the only vector that form its **basis**.\n",
    "    * A plane has 2 dimensions because points can be reached by **spanning** the only 2 vectors that form its **basis**.\n",
    "    * By **Span**, we mean: \n",
    "        * On 1-Dimension: take a vector $v$ and multiply it by a scalar (real number) $a_1$. Do this many times with different scalars and you will be able to reach every point in the real line and _span the real line_\n",
    "        * On 2-Dimensions: take 2 vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ (that form a **basis** of $\\textbf{V}$), multiply them by two scalars $a_1$ and $a_2$ and add/subtract them. Do this many times with different scalars and you will be able to reach every point in the space and _span the space_.\n",
    "    * By **Basis**, we mean: a list of vectors in $\\textbf{V}$ that are **Linearly Independent**.\n",
    "    * By **Linearly Independent**, we mean:\n",
    "        * Take a list of vectors $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$.\n",
    "        * If neither vector in this list can be generated by a **linear combination** (adding them and/or multiplying the by scalars) of others vectors in this list, then we say that these vectors are **linearly independent**. \n",
    "        * An example of a **Basis**, i.e., a collection of **linearly independent** vectors is the vectors that form the basis of the 3-D space: <img src=\"/img/3d.png\">\n",
    "* A **Vector Space** is a set $\\textbf{V}$ where you can do two important things among its elements: addition and scalar multiplication.<br>\n",
    "  Because of such properties, we say:\n",
    "    * $\\textbf{V}$ is a Vector Space over a Field $\\textbf{F}$. \n",
    "* Elements are now called **vectors** or **points**.\n",
    "* Although in mathematics a vector is defined as an _Ordered List of **Objects**_, in Machine Learning Theory, a vector is an _Ordered List of **Numbers**_. Thus, it is assumed that the Vector Space $\\textbf{V}$ where vectors lie is a **Real** Vector Space, i.e., $\\textbf{V} = \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "    * the reason for this is that computers do operations with numbers and Machine Learning is done by computers.\n",
    "* The easiest way to go about defining a vector is as it is done in **Statistics** and **Econometrics**:\n",
    "    * A **vector** is defined as a **column-vector**. It is written as a bold character **x**:\n",
    "    $\\textbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     x_{1} \\\\\n",
    "     x_{2} \\\\\n",
    "     \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "     x_{n}\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "however, to help with writing, we write them horizontally as $\\textbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$<br>\n",
    "More: vectors can be also interepreted as:\n",
    "        * an array of numbers (a computer science view) , hence the horizontal writting format,\n",
    "        * a vector as an arrow with a direction and magnitude (a physics view),\n",
    "        * and as an object that obeys addition and scaling/multiplication (a mathematical view) in the form of a column-vector.\n",
    "* An **attribute** (or **element** or **entry**) of a vector is defined as $x^{(i)}$ where **i** denotes a specifc **dimension** of the vector, i.e., it is the distance from the origin of a point in a real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ along an _independent direction_ that forms the vector space.\n",
    "    * Example  \n",
    "    $x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "                    3 \\\\\n",
    "                    4\n",
    "                  \\end{bmatrix}$ implies that $x^{(1)} = 3$ and $x^{(2)}$ = 4.\n",
